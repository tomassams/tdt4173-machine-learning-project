# tdt4173-machine-learning-project

Run the TDT4173_project.ipynb notebook, either locally with Jupyter Notebook, or in Google Colab by clicking "Open in Colab" at the top of the notebook.

If you do run it locally, you might need to install packages first with pip. In Colab, they should all be preinstalled.
